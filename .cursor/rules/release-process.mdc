# Release Process Guidelines

## Version Management

1. Update version in Xcode project
2. Create and push git tag (e.g., v0.16.7)
3. Create GitHub release with:
   - Appropriate release notes
   - Generated notes from commits
   - Proper tag association

## App Store Deployment

Use Fastlane's `upload_metadata` lane in [fastlane/Fastfile](mdc:fastlane/Fastfile):
```bash
bundle exec fastlane ios upload_metadata
```

This will:
- Get version from Xcode project
- Upload metadata and screenshots
- Submit for App Store review

## Post-Release

After successful deployment:
- Verify GitHub release is properly tagged
- Confirm App Store submission status
- Monitor for any submission feedback
